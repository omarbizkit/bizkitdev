GIT STATUS:

```
!`git status`
```

FILES MODIFIED:

```
!`git diff --name-only origin/HEAD...`
```

COMMITS:

```
!`git log --no-decorate origin/HEAD...`
```

DIFF CONTENT:

```
!`git diff --merge-base origin/HEAD`
```

Review the complete diff above. This contains all code changes in the PR.


OBJECTIVE:
Use the design-review agent to comprehensively review the complete diff above with HEADED BROWSER TESTING. The agent must:

1. **MANDATORY**: Launch headed browser in WSL with visible window using `headless: false`, `env: { DISPLAY: ':0' }`
2. Navigate through the UI with live browser observation for real-time testing
3. Capture screenshots during live navigation for evidence-based feedback
4. Provide comprehensive design review with visual evidence from browser navigation

Reply back to the user with the complete design review report including live browser testing evidence.

Follow and implement the design principles and style guide located in the ../`/specs/001-you-are-helping/spec.md` doc.
