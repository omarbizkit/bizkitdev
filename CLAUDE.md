## Code Style

- TypeScript: Follow strict mode, use interfaces for data models
- Components: Astro components with minimal JavaScript
- Styling: Tailwind utility classes, responsive design patterns
- Testing: TDD approach - tests before implementation
- Data: JSON-driven static generation, Supabase for dynamic data

- âœ… Test-driven development: Complete RED-GREEN-REFACTOR cycle with 84% coverage
- âœ… Performance: SEO optimization, image optimization, caching strategies
- âœ… Accessibility: WCAG AA compliance, keyboard navigation, screen readers
- âœ… SEO: Comprehensive meta tags, sitemap generation, semantic HTML, structured data
- âœ… Security: CSP headers, XSS protection, input sanitization, middleware

### Quick Visual Check
IMMEDIATELY after implementing any front-end change:
1. **Identify what changed** - Review the modified components/pages
2. **Navigate to affected pages** - Use `mcp__playwright__browser_navigate` to visit each changed view
3. **Verify design compliance** - Compare against `/specs/001-you-are-helping/spec.md`
4. **Validate feature implementation** - Ensure the change fulfills the user's specific request
5. **Check acceptance criteria** - Review any provided context files or requirements
6. **Capture evidence** - Take full page screenshot at desktop viewport (1440px) of each changed view
7. **Check for errors** - Run `mcp__playwright__browser_console_messages`

This verification ensures changes meet design standards and user requirements.

### Comprehensive Design Review
The design review workflow is now fully integrated with specialized agent and slash command support:

**Agent Integration**: Use the `design-review` agent (`.claude/agents/design-review-agent.md`) for comprehensive UI/UX validation following Silicon Valley standards (Stripe, Airbnb, Linear).

**Slash Command**: Execute `/design-review` (`.claude/commands/design-review-slash-command.md`) for complete diff review and automated Playwright testing.

**When to Use**:
- Completing significant UI/UX features
- Before finalizing PRs with visual changes  
- Needing comprehensive accessibility and responsiveness testing
- WCAG 2.1 AA compliance verification
- Cross-viewport testing (desktop 1440px, tablet 768px, mobile 375px)

**Review Process**: 7-phase methodology including interaction testing, responsiveness, visual polish, accessibility, robustness, code health, and console validation. Produces categorized findings (Blocker, High-Priority, Medium-Priority, Nitpick) with visual evidence.
