## Code Style

- TypeScript: Follow strict mode, use interfaces for data models
- Components: Astro components with minimal JavaScript
- Styling: Tailwind utility classes, responsive design patterns
- Testing: TDD approach - tests before implementation
- Data: JSON-driven static generation, Supabase for dynamic data

## 🐳 Container Runtime: Podman

**CRITICAL**: This project uses **Podman** as the preferred container runtime, not Docker.

### Podman Commands:
- `podman build` instead of `docker build`
- `podman run` instead of `docker run`
- `podman-compose` instead of `docker-compose`
- `podman system prune` instead of `docker system prune`

### Why Podman:
- Rootless containers (more secure)
- Better integration with systemd
- Compatible with Docker commands but more secure
- Preferred on RHEL/Fedora systems
- No daemon required (daemonless)

### Container Commands:
```bash
# Build image
npm run docker:build  # Uses podman build internally

# Run container
npm run docker:run    # Uses podman run internally

# Development environment
npm run docker:dev    # Uses podman-compose internally

# Production environment
npm run docker:prod   # Uses podman-compose internally

# Quick test
npm run docker:test   # Uses podman-compose internally
```

### Quick Visual Check
IMMEDIATELY after implementing any front-end change:
1. **Identify what changed** - Review the modified components/pages
2. **Navigate to affected pages** - Use `mcp__playwright__browser_navigate` to visit each changed view
3. **Verify design compliance** - Compare against `/specs/001-you-are-helping/spec.md`
4. **Validate feature implementation** - Ensure the change fulfills the user's specific request
5. **Check acceptance criteria** - Review any provided context files or requirements
6. **Capture evidence** - Take full page screenshot at desktop viewport (1440px) of each changed view
7. **Check for errors** - Run `mcp__playwright__browser_console_messages`

**🚀 Alternative**: Use `/design-review` command or the design-review agent for **fully automated** comprehensive testing with self-navigation, multi-viewport screenshots, accessibility scanning, and visual regression detection.

This verification ensures changes meet design standards and user requirements.

### Comprehensive Design Review
The design review workflow is now fully integrated with specialized agent and slash command support:

**Agent Integration**: Use the `design-review` agent (`.claude/agents/design-review-agent.md`) for comprehensive UI/UX validation following Silicon Valley standards (Stripe, Airbnb, Linear). **Automatically includes self-navigation checks and browser-based screenshots** for comprehensive feedback validation.

**Slash Command**: Execute `/design-review` (`.claude/commands/design-review-slash-command.md`) for complete diff review and automated Playwright testing with **built-in browser navigation and visual evidence capture**.

## 🎯 **How to Perform a Comprehensive UI Test**

### **Method 1: Invoke the Design Review Agent**
```markdown
@agent-design-review [your specific test request]

Examples:
✅ "@agent-design-review test the View Project button navigation and theme functionality"
✅ "@agent-design-review validate homepage responsive design across all viewports"
✅ "@agent-design-review comprehensive accessibility audit of navigation links"
✅ "@agent-design-review visual regression analysis for recent theme updates"
✅ "@agent-design-review test button interactions and hover states"
✅ "@agent-design-review performance and loading analysis for project pages"
✅ "@agent-design-review cross-browser compatibility for forms and interactions"
```

### **Method 2: Use Slash Command (if available)**
```bash
/design-review [description of what to test]
```

### **Method 3: Cross-Platform Browser Automation (Default Active)**
All platforms now support **fully automated browser testing** with 100% coverage. The system provides comprehensive screenshots and cross-environment validation across WSL, CI, and native platforms.
