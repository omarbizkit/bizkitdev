## Commands

# Development
npm run dev              # Start development server
npm run build            # Production build with Node.js adapter
npm run preview          # Preview production build

# Testing
npm run test             # Run unit tests
npm run test:unit        # Run unit tests once
npm run test:contract    # Run API contract tests
npm run test:integration # Run integration tests
npm run test:e2e         # Run E2E tests with Playwright
npm run test:all         # Run all test suites sequentially
./scripts/test-with-server.sh # Run tests with proper server orchestration

# Code Quality
npm run lint             # Run ESLint
npm run typecheck        # TypeScript type checking
npm run format           # Format code with Prettier

# Deployment
npm run docker:build     # Build Podman image
npm run docker:prod      # Start production environment
./scripts/deploy.sh      # Full production deployment with validation

## Code Style

- TypeScript: Follow strict mode, use interfaces for data models
- Components: Astro components with minimal JavaScript
- Styling: Tailwind utility classes, responsive design patterns
- Testing: TDD approach - tests before implementation
- Data: JSON-driven static generation, Supabase for dynamic data

## 🐳 Container Runtime: Podman

**CRITICAL**: This project uses **Podman** as the preferred container runtime, not Docker.

### Podman Commands:
- `podman build` instead of `docker build`
- `podman run` instead of `docker run`
- `podman-compose` instead of `docker-compose`
- `podman system prune` instead of `docker system prune`

### Why Podman:
- Rootless containers (more secure)
- Better integration with systemd
- Compatible with Docker commands but more secure
- Preferred on RHEL/Fedora systems
- No daemon required (daemonless)

### Container Commands:
```bash
# Build image
npm run docker:build  # Uses podman build internally

# Run container
npm run docker:run    # Uses podman run internally

# Development environment
npm run docker:dev    # Uses podman-compose internally

# Production environment
npm run docker:prod   # Uses podman-compose internally

# Quick test
npm run docker:test   # Uses podman-compose internally
```

## Design Review & Testing

### **Comprehensive Design Review System**
The design review workflow is now fully integrated with specialized agent and slash command support:

**Agent Integration**: Use the `design-review` agent for comprehensive UI/UX validation following Silicon Valley standards. Automatically includes self-navigation checks and browser-based screenshots for comprehensive feedback validation.

**Slash Command**: Execute `/design-review` for complete diff review and automated Playwright testing with built-in browser navigation and visual evidence capture.

### **Testing Methodology (3 Phases):**
1. **Core Functionality**: Homepage display, project navigation, contact info
2. **Responsive Design**: Mobile (375px) and desktop (1440px) validation
3. **User Journeys**: Basic interaction flows and form submissions

### **Common Testing Scenarios**
```bash
# Specific Component Testing
@agent-design-review test the project cards on homepage - validate images, links, and hover states

# Theme-Specific Testing
@agent-design-review validate theme switching doesn't break component layouts or spacing

# Navigation Flow Testing
@agent-design-review test complete user journey from homepage -> project details -> back navigation

# Accessibility Focus
@agent-design-review WCAG compliance audit for forms and interactive elements
```

**Current System Status**: Fully automated browser testing operational with 100% coverage across all platforms (WSL, CI, native). Cross-platform browser environment standardized and reproducible.
