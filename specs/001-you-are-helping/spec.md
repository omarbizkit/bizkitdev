## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines

- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements

- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation

When creating this spec from a user prompt:

1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### Primary User Stories

**Visitor Discovery Flow**
As a visitor, I want to quickly scan a grid of projects so I can discover interesting apps and demos, see their status (Idea/Development/Live), and choose which ones to explore further.

**Project Detail Exploration**
As a visitor, I want to click into a project card to view comprehensive details, screenshots, and direct links to launch the live application or view the source code.

**Professional Contact Flow**  
As a potential client, I want to read Omar's professional summary, see his technical skills through project tech stacks, and easily contact him via his direct email address.

**Subscription Engagement**
As an interested visitor, I want to subscribe with my email to receive updates when new projects are added to the portfolio.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** I visit the landing page, **When** I scroll to the projects section, **Then** I see a grid of project cards displaying name, short description, status badge, and tech stack icons
2. **Given** I click on a project card, **When** the detail page loads, **Then** I see the full project description, screenshot, status, tech stack, and links to launch app and view code
3. **Given** I want to contact Omar, **When** I navigate to the Contact section, **Then** I see his email address (omarbizkit@hotmail.com) clearly displayed
4. **Given** I want project updates, **When** I enter my email in the homepage subscribe form and click submit, **Then** I see a "Checking..." message and get redirected to the full subscription page if new, or a friendly message if already subscribed
5. **Given** I access the site on mobile, **When** I navigate through all sections, **Then** the layout remains responsive and all touch targets are appropriately sized
6. **Given** I'm on any page of the site, **When** I view the header and footer, **Then** I see consistent branding and navigation elements

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a project has no screenshot? (graceful fallback to placeholder)
- How does the system handle duplicate email subscriptions? (prevent duplicates, show appropriate message)
- What occurs if someone tries to launch an "Idea" status project? (disable launch button, show status-appropriate messaging)
- How does the site behave with very long project descriptions? (proper text truncation and "read more" functionality)
