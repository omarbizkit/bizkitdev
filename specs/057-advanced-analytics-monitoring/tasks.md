## Parallel Execution Examples

The remaining T099-T103 tasks can be executed efficiently using parallel agents:

### Execute T099-T103 (Final Optimization & Audits):
```bash
# Run audits and documentation in parallel (T101 and T102 can run together)
Task agent: "Perform analytics performance audit and bundle size analysis (T099)"
Task agent: "Conduct privacy compliance audit for GDPR/CCPA validation (T100)"
Task agent: "Execute security audit for analytics data handling and API security (T101)"
Task agent: "Validate analytics accuracy through manual testing and browser verification (T102)"
Task agent: "Prepare documentation and deployment checklist (T103)"
```

### Optimal Execution Strategy:
1. **T099** (Performance) - Can run independently, requires build analysis
2. **T100** (Privacy) - Can run independently, reviews compliance implementation
3. **T101 + T102** (Security + Accuracy) - Can run in parallel, both involve validation
4. **T103** (Documentation) - Can run concurrently with audits, updates final docs

## Dependencies

**Prerequisites Complete**: All implementation (T085-T093) and testing (T094-T098) phases completed âœ…

**Final Audit Dependencies**:
- T099 requires completed build to analyze bundle sizes
- T100-T102 require all analytics components to be implemented for comprehensive auditing
- T103 requires audit results to finalize documentation

**Completion Goal**: Achieve 100% Plan 057 completion with production-ready analytics

## Success Criteria
