# Tasks: Advanced Analytics & Performance Monitoring

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/057-advanced-analytics-monitoring/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

## Execution Flow (main)

```
1. Load plan.md from feature directory
   → Tech stack: GA4, Sentry, Web Vitals API, Custom consent management
   → Structure: Privacy-first analytics with performance monitoring
2. Load design documents:
   → data-model.md: Analytics event schemas and privacy entities
   → contracts/: Analytics API specifications
   → research.md: Privacy compliance and performance decisions
3. Generate tasks by category:
   → Tests: Contract validation for APIs and privacy compliance
   → Core: Analytics components, consent management, performance monitoring
   → Integration: Dashboard, error tracking, cross-browser testing
   → Polish: Performance optimization, documentation, compliance
4. Apply task rules:
   → Different files = mark [P] for parallel
   → Same file = sequential (no [P])
   → Tests before implementation (TDD)
5. Number tasks sequentially (T001, T002...)
6. Dependencies: Foundation → Core Analytics → Monitoring → Dashboard
7. Parallel execution: Independent component development
8. Validate completeness: Full analytics system with privacy compliance
```

## Notes

- [P] tasks target different files or independent components
- All contract tests must fail before implementation begins
- Privacy compliance is the highest priority - no tracking without consent
- Performance budget must be maintained throughout implementation
- Each component should be thoroughly tested for privacy compliance
- GDPR/CCPA compliance validation required at each major milestone

## Task Generation Rules Applied

1. **From API Contracts**:
   - Analytics API contract → T015-T018 (API endpoints)
   - Dashboard API contract → T037 (admin endpoints)
   - Consent API contract → T018 (privacy endpoints)

2. **From Data Model Entities**:
   - AnalyticsEvent → T011, T012, T015 (core tracking)
   - PerformanceMetrics → T019, T020, T016 (performance monitoring)
   - ConsentData → T007, T008, T018 (privacy management)
   - ErrorEvent → T023, T024, T017 (error tracking)

3. **From Privacy Requirements**:
   - GDPR compliance → T004-T006, T044, T050 (privacy tests)
   - Consent management → T007-T010 (privacy foundation)
   - Data protection → T009, T013 (middleware privacy)

4. **From Performance Requirements**:
   - Bundle size optimization → T054-T057 (performance polish)
   - Core Web Vitals → T019-T022 (monitoring implementation)
   - Performance budget → T057 (validation)
