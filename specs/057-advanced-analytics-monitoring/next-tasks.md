## Dependencies and Execution Order

### Critical Path Dependencies:
1. **Core Functions** (T076-T083) must be implemented before component integration
2. **Build Fixes** (T084-T088) must be completed before testing phases
3. **Component Integration** (T089-T093) must be finished before E2E testing
4. **All Implementation** (T076-T093) must be complete before final audits

### Parallel Execution Opportunities:
- **T076-T082**: Core analytics functions (different files)
- **T085-T087**: Middleware and provider updates (different files)
- **T089-T093**: Component integrations (different components)
- **T094-T098**: Test implementations (different test files)
- **T099-T101**: Audit tasks (different focus areas)

## Parallel Execution Examples

```bash
# Phase 6: Core functions can run in parallel
Task: "Implement createAnalyticsEvent() function in src/lib/analytics/events.ts"
Task: "Implement trackPageView() function in src/lib/analytics/tracking.ts"

Task: "E2E test: Analytics event tracking workflow"
Task: "E2E test: Consent management flow"
Task: "E2E test: Performance monitoring accuracy"
Task: "E2E test: Error tracking functionality"
```

## Success Criteria

### ❌ **MISSING (Critical Path)**
- Analytics API endpoints: 0/4 implemented (events, batch, errors, consent, dashboard)
- Core analytics functions: 8/8 missing from libraries
- Contract tests: Disabled (`analytics-events.test.ts` skipped)
- API directory structure: Missing endpoint files

## IMMEDIATE EXECUTION PLAN (TDD Approach)

### 🔥 **PHASE 5.1: CONTRACT TESTS (START HERE)**

**Rule**: These tests MUST fail first, then drive implementation

#### **T067-T070: Create Failing Contract Tests** [ALL PARALLEL]

- [ ] **T067** [P] Create `tests/contract/test_analytics_events_api.ts`
  - Test POST `/api/analytics/events` contract from `contracts/analytics-api.yaml`
  - Test POST `/api/analytics/events/batch` contract
  - Expected: RED (tests fail - endpoints don't exist)

- [ ] **T068** [P] Create `tests/contract/test_error_tracking_api.ts`
  - Test POST `/api/analytics/errors` contract from `contracts/analytics-api.yaml`
  - Expected: RED (tests fail - endpoint doesn't exist)

- [ ] **T069** [P] Create `tests/contract/test_consent_management_api.ts`
  - Test POST `/api/analytics/consent` contract from `contracts/analytics-api.yaml`
  - Test GET `/api/analytics/consent/{consentId}` contract
  - Expected: RED (tests fail - endpoints don't exist)

- [ ] **T070** [P] Create `tests/contract/test_dashboard_api.ts`
  - Test GET `/api/analytics/dashboard` contract from `contracts/analytics-api.yaml`
  - Expected: RED (tests fail - endpoint doesn't exist)

### 🔧 **PHASE 5.2: API IMPLEMENTATIONS (After contract tests fail)**

#### **T071-T075: Implement Missing API Endpoints** [MOSTLY PARALLEL]

- [ ] **T071** [P] Implement `src/pages/api/analytics/events.ts`
  - POST endpoint following `contracts/analytics-api.yaml` specification
  - Handle AnalyticsEvent schema validation
  - Integration with analytics libraries

- [ ] **T072** [P] Implement `src/pages/api/analytics/events/batch.ts`
  - POST endpoint for batch analytics events (max 100 events)
  - Efficient batch processing logic
  - Error handling for partial failures

- [ ] **T073** [P] Implement `src/pages/api/analytics/errors.ts`
  - POST endpoint for ErrorEvent tracking
  - Integration with Sentry configuration
  - Error categorization and filtering

- [ ] **T074** Implement `src/pages/api/analytics/consent.ts`
  - POST endpoint for consent updates
  - GET endpoint for consent retrieval
  - Cookie and consent storage management

- [ ] **T075** Implement `src/pages/api/analytics/dashboard.ts`
  - GET endpoint with admin authentication
  - Data aggregation from analytics sources
  - Query parameter handling (period, startDate, endDate)

## EXECUTION STRATEGY

### **Start with T067-T070 (Contract Tests)**

```bash
# Launch all contract tests in parallel - THEY SHOULD FAIL
Task: "Create tests/contract/test_analytics_events_api.ts - contract test for events API"
Task: "Create tests/contract/test_error_tracking_api.ts - contract test for error tracking API"
Task: "Create tests/contract/test_consent_management_api.ts - contract test for consent API"
Task: "Create tests/contract/test_dashboard_api.ts - contract test for dashboard API"
```

**Expected Result**: All tests RED (failing) because endpoints don't exist

### **Then T071-T075 (API Implementation)**

```bash
# Launch API implementations in parallel after contract tests fail
Task: "Implement src/pages/api/analytics/events.ts - POST analytics events endpoint"
Task: "Implement src/pages/api/analytics/events/batch.ts - POST batch events endpoint"
Task: "Implement src/pages/api/analytics/errors.ts - POST error tracking endpoint"
Task: "Implement src/pages/api/analytics/dashboard.ts - GET dashboard data endpoint"

# T074 runs separately (consent.ts) because it may need middleware updates
Task: "Implement src/pages/api/analytics/consent.ts - consent management endpoints"
```

**Expected Result**: Contract tests turn GREEN (passing)

## FILE STRUCTURE TO CREATE

```
src/pages/api/analytics/
├── events.ts                    # T071 - Single event tracking
├── events/

├── errors.ts                    # T073 - Error event tracking
├── consent.ts                   # T074 - Consent management

├── test_consent_management_api.ts # T069 - Consent API contracts
└── test_dashboard_api.ts        # T070 - Dashboard API contracts
```

## CONTRACT TEST TEMPLATE STRUCTURE

Each contract test should follow this pattern:

```typescript
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';

describe('Analytics Events API Contract', () => {
  test('POST /api/analytics/events should accept valid AnalyticsEvent', async ({ request }) => {
    const validEvent = {
      category: 'page_view',
      action: 'view',
      page: {
        path: '/',
        title: 'Test Page',
        url: 'http://localhost:4321/'
      },
      consentLevel: 'analytics'
    };

    const response = await request.post('/api/analytics/events', {
      data: validEvent
    });

    expect(response.status()).toBe(201);
    // Additional contract validation...
  });

  // More contract tests based on analytics-api.yaml...
});
```

## SUCCESS CRITERIA

**Phase 5.1 Complete When**:
- ✅ 4 contract test files created and failing (RED)
- ✅ Contract tests validate complete API specification
- ✅ Test runner shows expected failures for missing endpoints

**Phase 5.2 Complete When**:
- ✅ 5 API endpoint files implemented
- ✅ All contract tests passing (GREEN)
- ✅ API endpoints respond according to OpenAPI specification
- ✅ TypeScript compilation remains clean

## DEPENDENCIES

- **T067-T070 MUST complete before T071-T075** (TDD requirement)
- **T071-T073, T075 can run in parallel** (different files)
- **T074 sequential** (may need middleware coordination)
- **Contract specifications from `contracts/analytics-api.yaml`**
- **Type definitions from `src/types/analytics.ts`**

## PARALLEL EXECUTION READY

✅ **T067-T070**: 4 tasks can run simultaneously (different test files)
✅ **T071-T073, T075**: 4 tasks can run simultaneously (different API files)
⚠️ **T074**: Sequential (consent management may need middleware updates)

This execution plan follows pure TDD: Tests fail → Implementation → Tests pass → Refactor.

**NEXT ACTION**: Start with T067-T070 contract test creation in parallel.
