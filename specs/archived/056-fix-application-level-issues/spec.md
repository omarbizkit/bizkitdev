# Feature Specification: Fix Critical Application-Level Issues

## Overview

During our comprehensive E2E troubleshooting session, we identified 8 legitimate application-level issues that require fixing to ensure proper website functionality. While we successfully fixed 5 test infrastructure issues (38% improvement), the remaining failures reveal critical problems with core website features.

## Background Context

**Previous E2E Results**: 46 passed, 8 failed, 1 skipped, 4 did not run
**Root Cause**: Legitimate application functionality issues, not test script problems

## Critical Issues Identified

### 1. **Missing Project Card Test IDs** (Priority: Critical)
- **Problem**: ProjectCard component lacks `data-testid="project-card"` attribute
- **Impact**: E2E tests finding 0 project cards instead of expected 3+
- **Evidence**: `locator('[data-testid="project-card"], .project-card')` returns 0 elements
- **User Impact**: Project showcase functionality not properly accessible for testing

### 2. **Project Data Loading Issues** (Priority: Critical)
- **Problem**: 0 project cards being rendered on homepage
- **Impact**: Core portfolio functionality non-functional
- **Evidence**: Tests expect 3+ project cards but find none
- **User Impact**: Visitors cannot see featured projects

### 3. **Missing Core Content Elements** (Priority: High)
- **Problem**: Missing H1 elements and essential page content
- **Impact**: Page structure and SEO issues
- **Evidence**: Tests failing on basic content visibility checks
- **User Impact**: Poor SEO, accessibility, and content structure

### 4. **SEO Meta Tags Gaps** (Priority: High)
- **Problem**: Missing or improper SEO meta tags
- **Impact**: Search engine optimization and social sharing issues
- **Evidence**: SEO validation tests failing
- **User Impact**: Reduced discoverability and poor social media previews

### 5. **Accessibility Attribute Issues** (Priority: High)
- **Problem**: Missing accessibility attributes and ARIA labels
- **Impact**: Screen reader and keyboard navigation problems
- **Evidence**: Accessibility tests failing
- **User Impact**: Website not accessible to users with disabilities

### 6. **Performance Budget Violations** (Priority: Medium)
- **Problem**: Page load performance issues
- **Impact**: Slow user experience
- **Evidence**: Performance tests failing timing requirements
- **User Impact**: Poor user experience, especially on slower connections

### 7. **Internal Link Navigation** (Priority: Medium)
- **Problem**: Working internal links not functioning properly
- **Impact**: Site navigation issues
- **Evidence**: Link navigation tests failing
- **User Impact**: Broken internal site navigation

### 8. **Test Logic Inconsistencies** (Priority: Low)
- **Problem**: Troubleshooting workflow test expecting wrong behavior
- **Impact**: False test failures
- **Evidence**: `expect(formExists).toBe(false)` when form actually exists
- **User Impact**: No direct impact, but misleading test results

## Non-Functional Requirements

### NFR1: Performance
- **NFR1.1**: Homepage must load within performance budget (< 3 seconds)
- **NFR1.2**: Core content must be visible within 1 second
- **NFR1.3**: Images must be optimized and lazy-loaded

### NFR2: Testing
- **NFR2.1**: All E2E tests must pass after fixes
- **NFR2.2**: Test infrastructure must remain stable
- **NFR2.3**: False positive test failures must be eliminated

### NFR3: Maintainability
