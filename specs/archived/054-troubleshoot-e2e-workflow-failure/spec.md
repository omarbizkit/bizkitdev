# Feature Specification: Troubleshoot E2E Workflow Failure

## Overview
The recent workflow run "feat: implement WCAG AAA light theme compliance and organize design râ€¦ #53" failed during the E2E test phase. This feature aims to create a troubleshooting branch, pull workflow logs, identify root causes, and implement fixes.

## User Stories

### User Story 1: Branch Creation and Log Retrieval
As a developer, I want to create a dedicated troubleshooting branch that includes the last commit so I can properly investigate and fix E2E workflow failures without affecting main branch development.

### User Story 2: Workflow Log Analysis
As a developer, I want to retrieve and analyze the failed workflow logs from GitHub Actions so I can understand what specific E2E tests failed and why.

### User Story 3: Root Cause Identification
As a developer, I want to identify the root causes of the E2E test failures so I can systematically fix the issues.

### User Story 4: Test Infrastructure Debugging
As a developer, I want to debug the E2E test infrastructure to ensure Playwright configuration, port allocation, and environment variables are correctly set up for CI/CD.

### User Story 5: Fix Implementation and Validation
As a developer, I want to implement fixes for identified issues and validate them locally before merging back to main.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Branch `054-troubleshoot-e2e-workflow-failure` created with last commit included
- [ ] GitHub Actions workflow logs for failed run retrieved and analyzed
- [ ] Root cause of E2E failures identified (configuration, code, environment, dependencies)
- [ ] Local reproduction of E2E failures achieved
- [ ] Fixes implemented for identified issues
- [ ] E2E tests passing locally
- [ ] Changes committed with clear descriptions
- [ ] Ready for merge back to main branch

## Technical Requirements

### Functional Requirements

1. **Git Branch Management**
   - Create feature branch following naming convention `054-troubleshoot-e2e-workflow-failure`
   - Include the last commit that failed in CI/CD
   - Branch should be pushable and mergeable

2. **Workflow Log Retrieval**
   - Use GitHub CLI to fetch logs from failed workflow run
   - Support retrieving logs for specific workflow run ID #53
   - Parse and display relevant error information from logs

3. **E2E Test Analysis**
   - Execute failing tests locally to reproduce issues
   - Analyze Playwright configuration and test setup
   - Check port allocation and server orchestration
   - Validate environment variable configurations

4. **Fix Implementation**
   - Commit fixes with detailed descriptions
   - Test fixes locally before merging
   - Document changes for future reference

### Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance**: Local E2E tests should run within established timeouts
- **Compatibility**: Fixes should work on both local development and CI/CD environments
- **Observability**: Clear error messages and logging for debugging
- **Maintainability**: Changes should follow existing code conventions

## Dependencies

- GitHub CLI for log retrieval
- Playwright for E2E testing
- Access to failed workflow run #53
- Local development environment matching CI configuration

## Risk Assessment

- **High Risk**: Incomplete log analysis leads to missed root cause
- **Medium Risk**: Local fixes don't resolve CI/CD environment issues
- **Low Risk**: Branch creation and basic log retrieval fail

## Testing Strategy

- Manual verification of branch creation and log retrieval
- E2E test reproduction and validation locally
- Integration testing with CI/CD pipeline before merging

## Success Metrics

- Branch created successfully
- Failed workflow logs retrieved and analyzed
- Root cause identified within 2 hours of investigation
- E2E tests passing locally after fixes
- Changes merged back to main without issues
