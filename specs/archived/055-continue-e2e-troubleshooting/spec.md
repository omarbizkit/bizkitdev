# Feature Specification: Continue E2E Test Troubleshooting

**Feature ID**: 055-continue-e2e-troubleshooting
**Date**: 2025-09-16
**Status**: Analysis Phase
**Priority**: Critical - CI/CD Pipeline Reliability

## Overview

Continue the troubleshooting effort for End-to-End (E2E) test failures in the CI/CD pipeline. Previous troubleshooting made significant progress but critical configuration issues remain that prevent reliable E2E test execution in GitHub Actions.

## Problem Statement

Despite previous troubleshooting efforts that claimed "100% CI confidence" and "99.8% performance improvement", the E2E tests continue to fail in GitHub Actions due to fundamental configuration mismatches:

1. **Port Configuration Misalignment**: Tests expect port 4321 but dev server might be on different port
2. **Selector Strategy Issues**: Test selectors don't match actual DOM elements
3. **Server Lifecycle Management**: Inconsistent server startup/shutdown in CI environment
4. **Browser Environment Inconsistencies**: Different behavior between local and CI browser environments

## Current State Analysis

### Previous Progress
- Browser environment standardization attempted
- Performance optimizations implemented (timeout reductions)
- Cross-platform compatibility efforts made
- Headed browser testing capability added for WSL

### Remaining Issues
- E2E tests still failing in GitHub Actions with "Run E2E tests" step failures
- Port 4321 vs actual server port mismatches
- Subscription form selector `data-testid="hero-subscribe-form"` potentially not found
- Server health endpoint `/api/health` may not be responding correctly
- Test environment variables not properly loaded

## Functional Requirements

### FR1: Fix Port Configuration Alignment
- **Requirement**: Ensure all test configurations use consistent port numbers
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - Playwright config webServer port matches dev server port
  - All test files reference correct base URL
  - CI environment uses same port as local development

### FR2: Resolve Selector Strategy Issues
- **Requirement**: Ensure all test selectors match actual DOM elements
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - Subscription form test selectors work in both homepage and subscribe page
  - All interactive elements have consistent `data-testid` attributes
  - Tests can locate form inputs and buttons reliably

### FR3: Stabilize Server Lifecycle Management
- **Requirement**: Reliable server startup/shutdown in CI environment
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - Dev server starts successfully before tests run
  - Health endpoint `/api/health` responds consistently
  - Server cleanup happens properly after tests complete
  - No port conflicts or hanging processes

### FR4: Achieve CI/CD Test Reliability
- **Requirement**: E2E tests pass consistently in GitHub Actions
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - All E2E test suites pass in CI environment
  - No more "Run E2E tests" step failures
  - Test execution time remains optimized (under 5 minutes)
  - Cross-browser testing works reliably

## Non-Functional Requirements

### NFR1: Performance
- Maintain optimized test execution times (target under 5 minutes for full suite)
- Preserve fail-fast strategy with minimal retries

### NFR2: Reliability
- 95%+ success rate for E2E tests in CI environment
- Consistent behavior across different CI run environments

### NFR3: Maintainability
- Clear separation between local development and CI test configurations
- Comprehensive logging for troubleshooting future issues
- Documentation of all configuration decisions

## Technical Constraints

### Environment Constraints
- GitHub Actions Ubuntu environment
- Node.js with npm package manager
- Playwright testing framework
- Astro development framework
- WSL compatibility required for local development

### Existing Architecture
- Astro-based web application with SSR
- Supabase integration for backend services
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Mock environment variables for CI testing

## User Stories

### US1: Developer Running Tests Locally
**As a** developer working on the project
**I want** E2E tests to run reliably in my local environment
**So that** I can validate changes before pushing to CI

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Tests run successfully with `npm run test:e2e`
- Same configuration works in both WSL and native environments
- Clear error messages when tests fail

### US2: CI/CD Pipeline Execution
**As a** CI/CD system
**I want** to execute E2E tests reliably in GitHub Actions
**So that** deployments are properly validated

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- "Run E2E tests" step passes consistently
- All test scenarios execute within timeout limits
- Test results are properly reported and artifacts saved

### US3: QA Engineer Reviewing Test Results
**As a** QA engineer
**I want** detailed test failure information when E2E tests fail
**So that** I can quickly identify and resolve issues

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Clear error messages indicate specific failure points
- Screenshots and logs available for failed tests
- Test output includes relevant debugging information

## Success Criteria

### Primary Success Metrics
1. **E2E Test Pass Rate**: 95%+ success rate in GitHub Actions over 10 consecutive runs
2. **Configuration Consistency**: Zero port or URL mismatches between environments
3. **Selector Reliability**: All test selectors work without modification across test runs

### Secondary Success Metrics
1. **Execution Time**: E2E test suite completes in under 5 minutes
2. **Error Clarity**: Failed tests provide actionable error messages
3. **Documentation Quality**: All configuration decisions are documented

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk
- **Configuration Complexity**: Multiple configuration files need alignment
- **Environment Differences**: Local vs CI environment inconsistencies

### Medium Risk
- **Test Flakiness**: Some tests may be inherently unstable
- **Performance Regression**: Fixes might slow down test execution

### Low Risk
- **Breaking Changes**: Risk of breaking existing functionality is minimal

## Dependencies

### Internal Dependencies
- Astro development server configuration
- Playwright test framework setup
- GitHub Actions workflow configuration
- Package.json scripts and dependencies

### External Dependencies
- GitHub Actions runner environment
- Node.js and npm ecosystem
- Playwright browser installations
- Supabase mock services

## Timeline Estimate

### Phase 1: Configuration Analysis (1 day)
- Audit all configuration files for port and URL inconsistencies
- Document current vs expected configurations

### Phase 2: Fix Implementation (2 days)
- Align port configurations across all environments
- Fix selector strategies and DOM element matching
- Improve server lifecycle management

### Phase 3: Validation (1 day)
- Run comprehensive test suites in multiple environments
- Validate CI/CD pipeline reliability
- Update documentation

**Total Estimated Duration**: 4 days

## Acceptance Testing

### Test Scenario 1: Local Development Environment
1. Start development server with `npm run dev`
2. Run E2E tests with `npm run test:e2e`
3. Verify all tests pass without configuration changes
4. Confirm tests work in both WSL and native environments

### Test Scenario 2: CI/CD Pipeline Execution
1. Push changes to feature branch
2. Trigger GitHub Actions workflow
3. Verify "Run E2E tests" step completes successfully
4. Confirm all test scenarios pass within time limits

### Test Scenario 3: Cross-Browser Compatibility
1. Run E2E tests with multiple browser configurations
2. Verify Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit all work
3. Confirm mobile viewport testing functions correctly

## Notes

- This effort builds on previous troubleshooting work but takes a systematic approach to remaining issues
- Focus on configuration alignment rather than major architectural changes
- Preserve existing performance optimizations while fixing reliability issues
- Document all changes for future troubleshooting efforts
