# Tasks: E2E Workflow Failure Troubleshooting

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/054-troubleshoot-e2e-workflow-failure/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/, quickstart.md

## Execution Flow (main)

```
1. ✓ Load plan.md from feature directory
   → JavaScript/TypeScript (Node.js via Astro), Playwright, GitHub CLI
2. ✓ Load design documents:
   → data-model.md: Extract 5 entities → model tasks [P]
   → contracts/: 3 files → 3 contract test tasks [P]
   → research.md: Extract 5-phase troubleshooting → setup tasks
   → quickstart.md: Extract user stories → 10 integration scenarios
3. ✓ Generate tasks by category:
   → Setup: environment validation, dependency checks, GitHub CLI setup
   → Tests: 3 contract tests [P], 10 integration tests [P], 5 scenario tests
   → Core: 5 entity models [P], 4 implementation modules, API endpoints
   → Integration: workflow analysis, local reproduction, CI comparison
   → Polish: monitoring, documentation, performance validation
4. ✓ Apply task rules:
   → Different files = mark [P] for parallel
   → Same file = sequential (no [P])
   → Tests before implementation (TDD)
5. ✓ Number tasks sequentially (T001, T002...)
6. ✓ Generate dependency graph
7. ✓ Create parallel execution examples
8. ✓ Validate task completeness: All 3 contracts have tests ✓, All 5 entities have models ✓
9. ✓ Return: SUCCESS (22 tasks ready for execution)
```

## Format: `[ID] [P?] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- Include exact repository root paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

Based on plan.md: Single project at repository root with existing Astro framework

## Phase 3.1: Setup & Environment Validation

- [x] T001 [P] Set up GitHub CLI environment and authenticate access to omarbizkit/bizkitdev repository
- [x] T002 [P] Validate local development environment (Node.js version match CI requirements)
- [x] T003 Ensure Port 4321 availability and server health endpoint readiness
- [x] T004 [P] Install and validate Playwright browser binaries for local testing
- [x] T005 [P] Set up .env.test file with mock credentials for isolated testing

## Phase 3.2: Tests First (TDD) ⚠️ MUST COMPLETE BEFORE 3.3

**CRITICAL: These contract tests MUST be written and MUST FAIL before ANY implementation**

- [ ] T006 [P] Contract test for GitHub workflow analysis API in `tests/contract/test_github_workflow_api.ts`
- [ ] T007 [P] Contract test for local test execution API in `tests/contract/test_local_test_execution_api.ts`
- [ ] T008 [P] Contract test for configuration comparison API in `tests/contract/test_config_comparison_api.ts`
- [ ] T009 [P] Integration test for failed workflow run #53 log retrieval from omarbizkitdev/bizkitdev
- [x] T010 [P] Integration test for local E2E test reproduction with matching CI environment - COMPLETED: Created and executed workflow-diagnosis.spec.ts, identified subscription form missing
- [x] T011 [P] Integration test for port 4321 server startup and health check validation - VERIFIED: Server running with health endpoint responding
- [x] T012 [P] Integration test for environment variable consistency between local and CI - COMPLETED: Created comprehensive environment validation, revealed subscription form absence is root cause
- [ ] T013 [P] Integration test for Playwright timeout and browser compatibility scenarios
- [ ] T014 [P] Integration test for dependency version mismatch detection and resolution
- [ ] T015 Integration test for complete troubleshooting workflow (log → reproduce → analyze → fix)

## Phase 3.3: Core Implementation (ONLY after tests are failing)

### Entity Models [P] (Can run in parallel - different files)
- [ ] T016 [P] WorkflowRun entity model with state transitions in `src/models/workflowRun.ts`
- [ ] T017 [P] TestScenario entity model with browser/platform validation in `src/models/testScenario.ts`
- [ ] T018 [P] FailurePattern entity model with indicator matching in `src/models/failurePattern.ts`
- [ ] T019 [P] EnvironmentConfig entity model with CI/local comparison in `src/models/environmentConfig.ts`
- [ ] T020 [P] LogEntry entity model with parsing and validation in `src/models/logEntry.ts`

### Implementation Modules
- [ ] T021 Workflow analysis module implementing GitHub API log retrieval in `src/services/workflowAnalysis.ts`
- [ ] T022 Local test execution manager with health checks in `src/services/testExecutionManager.ts`
- [ ] T023 Configuration comparison engine for environment validation in `src/services/configComparison.ts`
- [ ] T024 Failure pattern detector with machine learning indicators in `src/services/failureDetector.ts`

## Phase 3.4: Integration & Complete Workflow

### API Endpoints Integration
- [ ] T025 [P] /api/health endpoint health verification in `src/pages/api/health.ts`
- [ ] T026 [P] /api/workflow-logs endpoint for log retrieval in `src/pages/api/workflow-logs.ts`
- [ ] T027 /api/workflow-analysis workflow execution analysis in `src/pages/api/workflow-analysis.ts`

### CI/CD Pipeline Integration
- [ ] T028 GitHub Actions workflow configuration validation in `.github/workflows/e2e-test.yml`
- [ ] T029 Server startup orchestration with proper port allocation
- [ ] T030 Environment variable isolation between CI and development modes

## Phase 3.5: Analysis, Fixes, and Prevention

### Root Cause Analysis
- [ ] T031 Implement log parsing and failure pattern matching for workflow run #53
- [ ] T032 Create local test reproduction scripts with exact CI environment replication
- [ ] T033 Configuration validation comparing omarbizkitdev/bizkitdev CI vs local environment

### Fix Implementation

- [ ] T041 [P] Performance validation ensuring E2E tests complete within 30 seconds
- [ ] T042 [P] Update quickstart.md with new failure patterns discovered
- [ ] T043 [P] Add unit tests for core troubleshooting modules
- [ ] T044 Run complete end-to-end workflow recovery validation

## Dependencies

### Critical Blocking Dependencies
- Tests (T006-T015) MUST complete before implementation (T016-T044)
- Entity models [P] (T016-T020) before services (T021-T024)
- Services (T021-T024) before API integration (T025-T027)
- Complete workflow implementation (T016-T030) before analysis (T031-T033)
- Analysis (T031-T033) before fixes (T034-T036)
- Implementation before prevention (T037-T039)
- Everything before polish (T040-T044)

### Parallel Execution Opportunities
```
# Setup tasks (can run together):
Task: "Set up GitHub CLI environment and authenticate access..."
Task: "Validate local development environment..."
Task: "Install and validate Playwright browser binaries..."
Task: "Set up .env.test file with mock credentials..."

# Contract tests (all independent):
Task: "Contract test for GitHub workflow analysis API..."
Task: "Contract test for local test execution API..."
Task: "Contract test for configuration comparison API..."

# Entity models (all independent files):
Task: "WorkflowRun entity model with state transitions..."
Task: "TestScenario entity model with browser/platform validation..."
Task: "FailurePattern entity model with indicator matching..."
Task: "EnvironmentConfig entity model with CI/local comparison..."
Task: "LogEntry entity model with parsing and validation..."
```

## Key Task Details

### Setup Tasks Priority Order
T001 → T002 → T003 → T004 → T005 (GitHub CLI first, then environment validation)

### Test Execution Dependencies
- All contract tests (T006-T008) require GitHub CLI setup (T001) and environment validation (T002)
- Integration tests (T009-T015) require full environment setup (T001-T005)

### Implementation Sequence
- Entity models → Service modules → API endpoints → Complete workflow → Analysis tools
- All entities must be implemented before any service can use them

### Validation Requirements
- [x] All 3 contract files have corresponding test tasks
- [x] All 5 entities from data-model.md have model tasks
- [x] Tests strategically placed before implementation (TDD compliance)
- [x] Parallel tasks validated as truly independent (different file paths)
- [x] Each task specifies exact repository root file path

## Success Criteria

- ✅ **22 executable tasks** generated with clear file paths and dependencies
- ✅ **TDD compliance** - all tests before implementation
- ✅ **Parallel execution** - 10+ tasks marked [P] for simultaneous processing
- ✅ **Complete coverage** - addresses all entities, contracts, and user stories
- ✅ **Dependency management** - critical blocking relationships identified

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files with no write conflicts
- Verify contract tests FAIL before implementing any core logic
- Commit after each task completion
- Total estimated execution time: 4-6 hours with parallel execution
- Focus: E2E workflow failure reproduction and systematic resolution
