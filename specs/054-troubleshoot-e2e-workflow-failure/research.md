# Phase 0 Research: E2E Workflow Failure Analysis

**Date**: 2025-09-13
**Research Focus**: Common E2E test failure patterns in Playwright + GitHub Actions CI/CD environment

## Research Scope

Based on the Technical Context analysis, all unknowns have been resolved. However, we'll conduct research on common E2E failure patterns to inform systematic troubleshooting approach.

## Research Tasks Dispatched

### Research Task 1: Playwright CI/CD Failure Patterns
**Target**: Common failure modes in GitHub Actions with Playwright
**Methodology**: Web search for documented issues, GitHub discussions, Playwright documentation
**Expected Outcomes**: Top 10 failure patterns, root causes, and quick diagnostics

### Research Task 2: Port and Server Configuration Issues
**Target**: Server startup, port allocation, and connection problems in CI environments
**Methodology**: Review Playwright configuration patterns, GitHub Actions webServer setup
**Expected Outcomes**: Configuration best practices, timeout settings, health check strategies

### Research Task 3: Environment Variable and Credential Management
**Target**: Mock credential systems, environment variable conflicts in CI
**Methodology**: Analyze existing `.env.test` setup, compare with successful CI configurations
**Expected Outcomes**: Secure credential handling, fallback mechanisms, isolation strategies

## Research Findings & Decisions

### Decision: Follow Systematic E2E Debugging Framework
**Context**: Need structured approach to identify root cause of failed workflow run #53
**Rationale**: Systematic debugging prevents shotgun debugging and ensures all potential failure points are addressed
**Implementation**: Multi-phase investigation starting with log retrieval, followed by local reproduction, then targeted fixes

**Decision Rationale**: Systematic approach ensures:
- All failure modes are considered systematically
- Root cause is identified before implementing fixes
- Fixes are validated before merging
- Similar issues are prevented in future

### Key Research Insights

1. **Playwright Common Failure Patterns**:
   - Timeout issues (elements not found, page not loading)
   - Browser context problems (multiple contexts, cleanup issues)
   - Server startup delays (port conflicts, health checks)
   - Environment inconsistencies (local vs CI differences)

2. **GitHub Actions Specific Issues**:
   - Resource constraints vs local development
   - Time zone and regional differences
   - Cache issues affecting test runs
   - Concurrent job interference

3. **Port Configuration Vulnerabilities**:
   - Dynamic port allocation conflicts
   - Firewall/routing issues in CI environment
   - Server not fully ready when tests start

## Troubleshooting Framework

### Phase A: Log Retrieval & Initial Analysis
1. Retrieve failed workflow run logs (attempted via GitHub CLI)
2. Identify specific test failures and error patterns
3. Determine if failure is isolated or systemic

### Phase B: Local Environment Isolation
1. Run failing tests locally to confirm reproduction
2. Compare environment configurations (local vs CI)
3. Verify dependencies, versions, and setup match CI

### Phase C: Configuration Deep Dive
1. Audit Playwright configuration for timeout settings
2. Review server startup scripts and health checks
3. Validate environment variables and mock setups

### Phase D: Targeted Fixes & Validation
1. Implement fixes based on identified root causes
2. Test fixes locally first
3. Validate in CI environment before merging

### Phase E: Prevention & Monitoring
1. Add monitoring hooks for similar failures
2. Document troubleshooting procedures
3. Implement proactive health checks

## Technical Insights

### Port 4321 Configuration
- **Current Status**: Already locked in as standard port per project context
- **Rationale**: Consistent port prevents allocation conflicts
- **Validation**: Ensure all CI jobs use same port and don't conflict

### Server Health Checks
- **Pattern**: Need robust server readiness verification
- **Implementation**: Health endpoint polling (`/api/health`) before test execution
- **Fallbacks**: Manual delay mechanisms, retry strategies

### Browser Instance Management
- **Pattern**: Single browser instance per test job
- **Cleanup**: Ensure proper browser termination between test runs
- **Resources**: Monitor for memory leaks or zombie processes

### Environment Isolation
- **Pattern**: Complete isolation between local, test, and CI environments
- **Implementation**: Separate `.env` files with clear boundaries
- **Validation**: Configuration verification before test execution

## Resolution Plan

**Immediate Action**: Begin with log retrieval to understand specific failure mode of workflow run #53
**Fallback Strategy**: If logs cannot be retrieved, implement monitoring hooks for next workflow run
**Success Criteria**:
- Root cause identified within first investigation phase
- Fixes validated locally before CI deployment
- CI workflow stability restored with monitoring

## Implementation Considerations

**No New Dependencies**: Leverage existing tools (GitHub CLI, Playwright)
**Minimal Code Changes**: Focus on configuration fixes rather than structural changes
**Documentation Priority**: Record troubleshooting approach for future reference
**Test Safety**: Maintain TDD principles even during infrastructure debugging
